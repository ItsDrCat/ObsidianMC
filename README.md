## How to use

### Before you Begin
Due to minecraft file quirkiness, only files in the /development_resource_packs/ folder inside of C:/Users/***INSERT USER HERE***/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState/games/com.mojang are actually used by Obsidian in most cases


If you want to use a pack with Obsidian, just copy over the pack folder from /resource_packs/ to /development_resource_packs/ or use the QuickSetupPack option on launch for Obsidian to do that for you. (For Deferred Presets, use QuickSetupPack-D to quickly prepare packs for Minecraft Preview)

### Let's convert a pack!


When you first open Obsidian, you will be greeted with several options on what to run. In our case we only care about QuickSetupPack and Obsidian to convert a pack.

Before we can get to converting packs, we much first "setup" a pack. To do that we will run the "QuickSetupPack" option in Obsidian's "main menu" (type it into the console), and doing this should greet you with a list of currently installed packs (If it returns nothing then you have no installed packs). To select a pack to prepare, type its name into the console and then press enter. If done correctly, the window should close itself shortly after and then you should be ready to move onto the next step.

We should now be ready to convert a pack! Run Obsidian again and this time select the "Obsidian" option. When you do this you will be given a list of all currently available presets. Each of these presets change how the pack will generate, so choose the one that you think will look best (You can learn how to add custom presets by reading the DEVGUIDE.md file). After doing this you will recieve a list of all currently available packs that Obsidian can access. Simply enter then name of the one you wish to convert with Obsidian and then wait around 15-60 seconds until the window automatically closes itself.

If your Obsidian window looks something like this after a few seconds, Obsidian has sucessfully converted a pack and you should see a new pack named "**Insert pack name here**"-Obsidian in your games available resource packs.
